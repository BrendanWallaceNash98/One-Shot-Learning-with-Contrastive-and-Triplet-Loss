# Contrastive-Loss-and-Triplet-Loss

11/5/2022

Two convolutional neural siamese networks were built using contrastive loss and triplet loss on the TensorFlow's ominglot data set (a collection of 1623 unique handwritten letters from 50 languages) in an attempt to develop neural networks for one-shot classifiaction for identify if two characters are from the same language or not. Both models where trained on letters from 40 of the 50 langauges and then tested on 10 untrained langauges.
